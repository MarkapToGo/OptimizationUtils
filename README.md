# OptimizationUtils

A minecraft plugin with some useful optimization utils (see below).

## Requirements

- Paper 1.21+ (older versions may not work. Pull requests are appreciated!)
- Java 21+

## Features

- **Dynamic mobcap** - automatically throttles mob spawning (optionally spawners too) when MSPT exceeds a configurable threshold.
- **Dynamic random tick speed** - automatically turns random ticks off when MSPT exceeds a configurable threshold.
- **Disable entity ticking** - stops ticking selected mobs (they stay in the world, but no AI/movement). Two modes: disabled entity ticking entirely, or uses Bukkit's `Mob#setAware`. Mobs can be filtered by entity type or Bukkit class, with include/exclude lists.
- **Runtime tweaks via commands** - change view distance (globally or per player, persisted), simulation distance, mobcaps, mob spawn frequency and villager tick rates without a restart.
- **Diagnostics** - analyze which chunks hold the most entities, kill entities/animals far away from players, and a detailed `/ou info` overview.
